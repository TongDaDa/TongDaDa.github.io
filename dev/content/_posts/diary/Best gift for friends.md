Coming up with the right gift for friends is challenging. 
You have to think about their personality and their current interests are, once you find what seems to be the right gift, 
the price tag could stun you.

Usually, a gift for friends had better been memorable and thoughtful, 
instead of an expensive gift which could lose the real value of the gift. 
In most cases, people want to get a utilizable and practical gift to satisfy their rigid demands. 
for example, if you get a pricey gift from your friend then you may not use it to your daily life as saving its value, 
because it is very valuable, you are reluctant to use it, and worry about the safety of the gift.
 So, the expensive gift has lost memorable value as the recipient would quickly forget it.

However, a handmade gift could express more honest for presenting a gift. 
First, it represents your concerns and importance for the gift although it is cheaper than others. 
Second, the time you spent to make this gift is more expensive than money.

Moreover, it could free your friends' pressure for retaliating the equal value.
 If your friends receive an expensive gift, they will choose an equal value gift to retaliate you accordingly. 
 Finally, it could let the friendship more money-oriented and may trouble your friends, 
 since they would not like to spend a lot of money to exchange expensive gifts.

In short, Happiness does not come from the money spent on purchasing the gift, 
It comes from the intension of the person presenting the gift.
