## Foreword

--- 

This is an impression of the view for the series of “this is us”, and I have watched three chapters untile today.

Firstly, I was very inspired by this show, totally it described an unoriginal and complicated family that how to live together
 and lots of kind of difficulty even these children have grown up. The family fills up with warm and the hot heart,  everyone 
 shows a hoping and stronger mind, they met a lot of problems in their life accompanying them in childhood and adulthood, 
 such as the racial discrimination and the anxious heart between adoptive parents and biological parents.

These is pretty unthinkable things around our life, there have lots of emotional relationships than our thinking. For example, 
A mom chooses a  baby who is not from her body as one of her three-babies, which has gone during delivery. 
The unbelievable thing is that the baby is not a white person like them. We know, right?  A white person has no little chance to conceive a black baby. 
Maybe that could be acceptable for a normal baby that has the same skin color because the mom needs a baby to stand the space for her gone baby. But for Rebecca, 
the mom, and her husband named Jack, they do not think the baby is a replacement for their lost baby, and they love the black baby than the other two babies.

This is great series i watched, and I will write a impression of view every week for the show as below.
