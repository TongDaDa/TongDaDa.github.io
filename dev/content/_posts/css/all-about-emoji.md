## Foreword
I was used the native char to represent the emoji in browser, but today I found a problem that it does not be supported by some computers, most cases in Win7, XP. So a question emerge on my mind, why it doesn't show?

We knew The charset is preserved in the disk by our system, and charset is a set that includes many chars, which one is mapping by a `glyph`, it is very important for wherever it shows a font on our computer. And

if you have a little obscure for above text, you could read some document about the `Unicode encoding` and `glyph` on Wiki.
